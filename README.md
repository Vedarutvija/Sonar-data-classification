# SONAR Data Classification Using Single Artificial Neural Network

The whole sonar data set contains 111 patterns obtained by bouncing sonar#signals off a metal cylinder at various angles and under various#conditions.  The whole sonar data set contains 97 patterns obtained from#rocks under similar conditions.  The object is to predict if the returning#signal is from a rock or a mine.
